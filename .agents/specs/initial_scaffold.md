# Technical Specification Mapping — Electron/TS Scaffold (Step 1)

Maps [functional_domain.md](functional_domain.md)'s Step 0 analysis to a concrete architecture plan.

## The Inward Dependency Rule

There is no domain/core layer yet — one is deliberately deferred (per Step 0, no transformation logic exists to protect). At scaffold stage the rule manifests as **process-boundary isolation** instead:

- `src/main`, `src/preload`, `src/renderer` do not reach into each other's internals. They only communicate through the explicit bridge contract (`src/preload/api.ts`).
- `src/renderer` never imports `electron` or `node:*` directly — its only channel to the outside is `window.mdview` (the bridge global).
- When a `src/core` (or `src/domain`) package appears in a later step, `src/main`/`src/preload` will depend inward on it — not the reverse. Nothing today violates that future direction.

## SOLID Boundary Scan

- **ISP** — the bridge API (`src/preload/api.ts`) is a named, narrow TypeScript type, not `any`. Growing it later is additive; nothing downstream has to widen a blind cast.
- **SRP** — `src/main/index.ts` does exactly one thing: process/window lifecycle. Window *configuration* (security-relevant `webPreferences`) is split into `src/main/windowConfig.ts` so it's independently testable and doesn't get buried in lifecycle code as IPC handlers accrue later.
- **DIP** — main depends directly on Electron's own abstractions (`app`, `BrowserWindow`); Electron *is* the outermost boundary here, so wrapping it in a further interface today would be premature abstraction with no second implementation to justify it.

## Pattern Application (GoF)

- **Facade** — `src/preload/index.ts` is a thin facade wiring `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld` to the pure `api.ts` contract. It exists so the renderer never sees `contextBridge`/`ipcRenderer` mechanics directly, even as the API surface grows.
- **Composition Root** — `src/main/index.ts` is the single place the app is wired together (window creation, lifecycle events). No Factory/Strategy/Observer is introduced: there is no variability yet to manage, and forcing one in now would violate the project's "don't design for hypothetical requirements" principle.

```

**Deliberate omissions, stated explicitly:**
- No `src/renderer/index.ts` — renderer has no logic to type-check or test yet (Step 0 requirement: "sin lógica, solo hello world"). Adding an empty TS entry point just to have one would be scope creep; it lands in the step that adds real renderer behavior.
- No `tsconfig.main.json` / `tsconfig.renderer.json` split — main and preload share one Node/Electron-context config, and renderer has no TypeScript to compile. A single `tsconfig.json` matches the scope contract's literal file list and avoids an unnecessary project-references setup for zero renderer code.
- No `src/core` / `src/domain` — nothing to put there yet per Step 0.

## Why main/preload/renderer are testable without a running Electron instance

`api.ts` and `windowConfig.ts` are plain data/TS modules with no `electron` runtime calls at import time (`windowConfig.ts` only imports Electron's *types*, not its runtime). `index.ts` in both main and preload is the only place that touches live Electron APIs (`contextBridge`, `app`, `BrowserWindow`) — so unit/integration tests target the pure modules, and only the e2e Playwright test needs a real Electron process. This is what makes "one trivial green test per tests/ folder" honest rather than a rubber stamp.

## Build & Scripts

- `build`: `tsc -p tsconfig.json` (emits `dist/main/**`, `dist/preload/**`) followed by copying `src/renderer/index.html` → `dist/renderer/index.html` (electron-builder packages `dist/**` only, so the static HTML must land there too).
- `dev`: `build` then `electron .` (package.json `"main": "dist/main/index.js"`).
- `test:unit` / `test:integration`: `vitest run tests/unit` / `tests/integration` respectively (one `vitest.config.ts`, filtered by directory argument).
- `test:e2e`: `build` (dist must exist for Playwright to launch it) then `playwright test`.
- `test:all`: runs all three in sequence.
- `package` (bonus, not in the original required list, needed to actually use electron-builder): `electron-builder`.

## Package manager / module system

- CommonJS output for main+preload (`"module": "CommonJS"` in tsconfig) — avoids Electron ESM-preload edge cases entirely at scaffold stage.
- `strict: true` in tsconfig from this first commit, per requirement.

*Note: a post-review fix (`fix(tsconfig): use node16 module/moduleResolution pair`) later changed `module`/`moduleResolution` from `CommonJS` to `Node16`. Output is still CommonJS-shaped (Node16 resolution with no `"type": "module"` in package.json compiles to `.js` files Node/Electron load as CommonJS) — the ESM-preload avoidance goal above still holds, just via a different compiler setting. Recorded here for accuracy; not part of this task's diff.*

## Task 2 Technical Specification — Open & Render Markdown

Maps `functional_domain.md`'s Task 2 analysis to concrete design.

### The Inward Dependency Rule

- `src/main/markdown.ts` is this project's first real domain-ish module: pure `string -> string`, zero Electron import, zero I/O. Everything else in this task depends *outward* toward it (main's IPC handler calls it; nothing calls back).
- The IPC contract (channel names + message types) lives in `src/preload/api.ts` as the shared abstraction both `src/main/index.ts` and `src/preload/index.ts` depend on — neither side hardcodes the other's strings. This is DIP applied to the process boundary itself: main and preload both depend on a shared type, not on each other.
- `src/renderer/renderer.js` still only touches `window.mdview` — never `electron`, never `node:*`. The inward-dependency boundary from Task 1 is unchanged; the bridge surface it depends on just grew.

### SOLID Boundary Scan

- **ISP** — `BridgeApi` grows by exactly two members (`openFileDialog`, `onFileRendered`); nothing existing widens. `renderer.js` uses only what it needs.
- **SRP** — `markdown.ts` does one thing (convert). `main/index.ts` gains orchestration (argv parsing, dialog wiring, IPC handler registration) but no parsing logic of its own — it calls `markdownToHtml`, it doesn't reimplement any part of it. `windowConfig.ts` is untouched (correctly — window chrome config has no relationship to file rendering).
- **DIP** — `main/index.ts` and `preload/index.ts` both depend on the `BridgeApi`/`IPC_CHANNELS`/`FileRenderedMessage` contract declared in `preload/api.ts`, not on each other's implementation.

### Pattern Application (GoF)

- **Adapter** — `markdown.ts` adapts the third-party `markdown-it` library behind a single narrow function (`markdownToHtml`). Nothing outside this file ever imports `markdown-it` directly — if the library is ever swapped, one file changes.
- **Facade** — `preload/index.ts` still owns the sole `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld` call, now constructing a richer `BridgeApi` object (version passthrough + two `ipcRenderer`-bound methods) but still the only file that touches `contextBridge`/`ipcRenderer`.
- No new pattern is forced for the dialog-vs-argv duality — per the functional-domain guardrail, both triggers call the same `renderFile` orchestration function; that's a shared-function call, not a variability point that needs Strategy/Command.

### IPC Contract (authoritative — implement exactly this)

Declared in `src/preload/api.ts`, imported by both `src/main/index.ts` and `src/preload/index.ts`:

```ts
export const IPC_CHANNELS = {
  OPEN_FILE_DIALOG: 'md-view:open-file-dialog',
  FILE_RENDERED: 'md-view:file-rendered',
} as const;

export interface FileRenderedOk {
  ok: true;
  filePath: string;
  html: string;
}

export interface FileRenderedError {
  ok: false;
  filePath: string | null;
  error: string;
}

export type FileRenderedMessage = FileRenderedOk | FileRenderedError;

export interface BridgeApi {
  readonly version: string;
  openFileDialog(): void;
  onFileRendered(callback: (message: FileRenderedMessage) => void): void;
}
```

**The existing `bridgeApi` const (`{ version: '0.0.0-scaffold' }`) is kept, unchanged, in `api.ts`** — it and the Task 1 unit test that imports it both keep working untouched. `api.ts` stays 100% free of any `electron` import (still grep-verifiable, still the property the reviewer checked last time); the new pieces above are types and string constants only. `preload/index.ts` (which already legitimately imports `electron`) is where `bridgeApi.version` and the two live `ipcRenderer`-bound methods get assembled into the object actually passed to `exposeInMainWorld` — the *contract* is declared in `api.ts`, the *implementation* stays in `index.ts`, exactly like Task 1's Facade split.

`openFileDialog()` is fire-and-forget (`ipcRenderer.send`, not `invoke`) — the result doesn't come back as a return value, it arrives later on the same `FILE_RENDERED` channel that argv-triggered opens use, per the "one path" guardrail. `onFileRendered`'s wrapper strips the raw Electron event object before calling the caller's callback, passing only the typed `FileRenderedMessage` payload — preserves Task 1's "no raw primitives leak to the renderer" guardrail.

### Main-process orchestration (`src/main/index.ts`)

- `argvFilePath()`: scans `app.isPackaged ? process.argv.slice(1) : process.argv.slice(2)` for the first entry ending in `.md` (case-insensitive) — a content-based scan, not a fixed positional index, so it's robust to both `electron .` (dev) and `electron dist/main/index.js <file>` (how the e2e test launches it) without special-casing the test.
- `renderFile(filePath)`: rejects non-`.md` paths and read failures into `FileRenderedError`, otherwise reads the file and returns `{ ok: true, filePath, html: markdownToHtml(source) }`. This is the *one* function both triggers call.
- Startup: create the window, resolve `argvFilePath()`, and if present, render it and send once `did-finish-load` fires (sending earlier would race the renderer's `onFileRendered` subscription and silently drop the message).
- `ipcMain.on(IPC_CHANNELS.OPEN_FILE_DIALOG, ...)`: opens a native dialog filtered to `*.md`, and on a real selection, calls the same `renderFile` and sends the same way.
- This orchestration is not unit-tested directly (importing `main/index.ts` triggers `app.whenReady()` side effects outside Electron, same reason Task 1 kept `index.ts` untested-in-isolation) — it's covered by the e2e test instead, which is the right level for "does the whole pipeline work," not the wrong level to skip testing at.

### Renderer (`src/renderer/renderer.js`, plain JS, no build step)

- Subscribes once via `window.mdview.onFileRendered`; on `ok: true` sets `container.innerHTML = message.html`, on `ok: false` renders a plain-text error state into the same container. `innerHTML` assignment here is safe *because* `markdownToHtml` guarantees `html:false` — this is exactly why guardrail #1 is tested, not just configured.
- One button (`#open-file-btn`) calling `window.mdview.openFileDialog()` — the simplest dialog trigger; a native `Menu`/accelerator is more idiomatic Electron but is main-process surface area this task doesn't need to add.

### Dependency placement (correctness detail, not explicitly specified by the task but load-bearing for packaging)

`markdown-it` and `github-markdown-css` are used by the **shipped application** (main process requires `markdown-it` at runtime; the renderer loads the CSS file at runtime) — they must go under `"dependencies"`, not `"devDependencies"`, or `electron-builder` will prune them from the packaged app. `@types/markdown-it` is type-only → `"devDependencies"`, consistent with the existing `@types/node` placement.

### Build script change

`build` must additionally copy `src/renderer/renderer.js` → `dist/renderer/renderer.js` (same reason `index.html` is copied: `tsc` doesn't touch non-`.ts` files, and only `dist/**` gets packaged) and copy `node_modules/github-markdown-css/github-markdown.css` → `dist/renderer/github-markdown.css`. Touching `package.json`'s `scripts.build` value is within the scope contract's grant of the whole `package.json` file, not just its dependency lists — flagging explicitly since the task description's parenthetical only mentioned dependencies.

### Addendum: preload must be bundled (discovered mid-implementation, user-approved)

**Problem, evidence-based.** `windowConfig.ts` sets `sandbox: true` (Task 1, unrequested-but-benign hardening at the time). Electron's sandboxed preload context runs a polyfilled `require()` limited to an allowlist (`electron`, `events`, `timers`, `url`) — it cannot resolve local sibling files by relative path. The mandated preload split above (`api.ts` contract / `index.ts` facade, `import { bridgeApi, IPC_CHANNELS } from './api'`) compiles to a runtime `require('./api')`, which the sandbox rejects: `window.mdview` ends up `undefined` at runtime, confirmed by launching the real built app under Playwright and capturing the renderer's console/pageerror output. This was latent since Task 1 (nothing there ever called `window.mdview`, so nothing exercised the failure) and only surfaced now that `renderer.js` actually calls `window.mdview.onFileRendered(...)`.

**Decision (Lead + user, not the engineer's call — it touches an architectural tradeoff, not just code):** bundle the preload script rather than relax `sandbox: true` or collapse the `api.ts`/`index.ts` source split. This keeps every existing invariant intact — `windowConfig.ts` stays untouched (`sandbox: true` unchanged), the DIP/Facade source split from earlier in this document stays intact (contract in `api.ts`, implementation in `index.ts`, still two files, still the same reasoning) — and resolves the constraint at the build boundary instead: the *source* stays split for authoring/testability reasons, the *shipped artifact* is a single bundled file with zero runtime local `require()` calls, which is what the sandboxed preload actually requires. This is the standard mitigation for non-trivial sandboxed Electron preload scripts.

**Rejected alternatives, and why:** `sandbox: false` would have worked and touched only one line, but throws away hardening for a problem that has a better fix. Merging `api.ts` into `index.ts` would "work" but destroys the DIP/Facade separation this very document argues for, just to route around a tooling limitation — treating source architecture as disposable is the wrong tradeoff.

**Implementation, entirely within the existing Task 2 scope contract — no scope amendment needed:**
- Add `esbuild` to `package.json` `devDependencies` (build tool, not shipped — correctly dev, unlike `markdown-it`/`github-markdown-css`).
- `build` script gains one more step, after the existing `tsc -p tsconfig.json`: bundle `src/preload/index.ts` directly (esbuild transpiles TS itself) into `dist/preload/index.js`, `--bundle --platform=node --format=cjs --external:electron`, overwriting `tsc`'s own emitted `dist/preload/index.js`. `tsc` still compiles and strict-type-checks `src/preload/**/*.ts` as before (including `api.ts` and `index.ts`) — esbuild's job is purely to reshape the *shipped* preload artifact, not to replace type-checking. `--external:electron` is required: `electron` must stay a runtime `require('electron')` in the bundle (the sandbox's own allowlist provides it), not get bundled in — bundling it would either fail (no real `electron` module to bundle at build time) or produce a nonfunctional stub.
- No new file needed: this is one additional esbuild CLI invocation in `package.json`'s existing `build` script string, the same "no new script file" discipline already used for the `index.html`/`renderer.js`/CSS copy steps.
